## The 'Validate converted XForm with ODK Validate' option is disabled. How do 
I enable it?

ODK Validate needs Java to be installed and available in your PATH. 

If you don't have Java installed, download it from http://java.com/en/download.

If after you install and reboot, you still cannot validate, it is likely you do 
not have Java in your PATH. Follow the instructions at 
http://java.com/en/download/help/path.xml to add Java to your PATH.



## XLSForm Offline.app cannot be opened. It says it is from an unidentified 
developer.

This message is from Gatekeeper (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290), a feature 
in Mac OS X 10.7 and later that helps protect your Mac from malware and 
misbehaving apps downloaded from the Internet.

To allow your Mac to run XLSForm Offline.app, follow these three steps.

1. In Finder, Control-click or right click the XLSForm Offline.app icon.
2. Select Open from the top of contextual menu that appears.
3. Click Open in the dialog box. If prompted, enter an administrator name and 
password.

You only have to do this once. XLSForm Offline.app will now run without the 
warning from Gatekeeper.
